# LAPS

The `LAPS` package for R bundles the data
collected in the
[LAPS](https://centre-plurilinguisme.ch/en/research/language-aptitude-why-and-how-assess-it) project
(Institute of Multilingualism, Fribourg, Switzerland).
The project's findings are reported in [_Individual differences in early instructed language learning: The role of language aptitude, cognition, and motivation_](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5378471) (edited by Raphael Berthele and Isabelle Udry).

## Installation

You can install the `LAPS` package as follows. (Make sure the `devtools` package
is installed.)

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("janhove/LAPS")
```

## Datasets

Two datasets are included:

* `construct_scores`: Construct scores for the cognitive and questionnaire-based constructs.
* `full_data`: All data.

To make these datasets available in your `R` session:

```{r}
library(LAPS)
data(construct_scores)
dim(construct_scores)
data(full_data)
dim(full_data)
```


For more information about these datasets, see the technical report
at https://osf.io/hstv7/.
